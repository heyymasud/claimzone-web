### 🐛 Fix: Zustand store freeze after opening external tab
- Fixed an issue where auth and favorite actions became unresponsive after opening external links via `window.open()`.
- Root cause: event loop suspension during concurrent async Supabase calls.
- Solution: deferred Supabase queries in `fetchUserStats()` and `loadFavorites()` using `setTimeout` to allow React commit completion.
